The operating system has since gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being 8.1 \"Oreo\", released in December 2017.

Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel. \n\nmore\n.",
